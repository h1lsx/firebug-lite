== Firebug Lite Change Log ==
2009-08-28 Pedro Simonetti <pedrosimonetti@gmail.com>
  * firebug-lite.js: Fixed problem with selection of elements in HTML panel. 
                     It was trying to access getAttribute() function of comment 
                     nodes, and this was causing an error.
                     
                     Fixed problem with the "outline inspector". It was not 
                     possible to inspect child nodes of the currently inspected 
                     element, for example, if you are inspecting a UL element, 
                     you won't be able to select the LI elements inside of it.

  * firebug-lite.js: Issue 1400 - firebug.env.override is now false by default ... I have also added
                                  two methods to make it easier for the user to control the console:
                                  firebug.overrideConsole() & firebug.restoreConsole()

2009-02-09 Mike Ratcliffe <sabine.michael.ratcliffe@gmail.com>

                                  The reason this is needed is because a number of browsers have a window.console object.

    is a getter and allow more control over initialization.

  * firebug-lite.js: Moved console initialization code inside of the Firebug object to remove some global variables

    to their primitive counterparts
  * firebug-lite.js & firebug-lite.css: Fixed Issue 1023 - Elements such as Flash in iframes and dropdowns in IE bleed through FBLite,
                                        I have put an iframe 'shield' behind FBLite to prevent this
  * Updated mime-types for all FBLite SVN files

2009-02-05 Mike Ratcliffe <sabine.michael.ratcliffe@gmail.com>
  * firebug-lite.js: Added firebug.env.detectFirebug to prevent FBLite opening when Firebug is enabled (actually the Firebug Console).
                     To run FBLite and Firebug at the same time it is now necessary to change the value of detectFirebug directly in firebug-lite.js
  * Fixed multiple console initialization and override issues

2009-02-05 Azer Koculu <azer@kodfabrik.com>
  * firebug-lite.css: mime-type property has been set to "text/css".
